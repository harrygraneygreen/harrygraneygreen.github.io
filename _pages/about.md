# Hello, welcome to my website!
### I'm Harry Graney Green

I am a Software Engineer based in the NYC area and I work at SMBC.

I studied Computer Science at Georgia Tech.

I enjoy working on projects that combine math and cool software. 

Outside of work, I enjoy playing violin, reading, and exercising.
